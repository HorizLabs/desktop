# Horizon 
*The testing platform to complement Horizon Server*

## About Horizon Desktop

Horizon Desktop is the desktop app developed and maintained by Horizon Labs as to serve as the complement for the horizon labs server for taking tests. Test-making and test-taking is tough with there not being many complete applications for it that also ensure complete privacy, which is why the Horizon platform was created with it being completely open-source and being developed. The desktop application is usable through this repository, with it being under the AGPL-3 license for individuals to be able to explore and understand the inner workings of the platform, with it being based on React and Tauri.

Even though we will have releases downloadable, we also offer the ability for you to compile the application yourself, with the following sections after the Contributing section being on that.
